# DevSecOps Mesh Pipeline

## Overview
This repository provides a reference implementation of a **secure DevSecOps pipeline** on **Kubernetes**, leveraging an **Istio service mesh** to showcase automated security workflows such as **mTLS**, intelligent **traffic management**, and **observability** for microservice architectures.

## Features
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** for secured service-to-service communication.
- **Traffic management** using Istio for resilience and security.
- **Observability**, including metrics and tracing for security visibility.
- **Microservices architecture** comprising:
  - `auth-api` (authentication service)
  - `backend-api` (business logic service)
  - `frontend` (user-facing interface)
- **CI/CD integration**, potentially via GitHub Actions workflows.
- **Local development setup** with Docker Compose (`docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.dev.yml`).
- **Infrastructure as Code** configuration stored under `k8s/`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes cluster (local like Minikube or remote)
- `kubectl` configured to communicate with the cluster
- Istio service mesh installed and configured
- Docker for building and running services locally

### Local Development (Docker Compose)
1. Copy the example environment variables:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2. Launch services:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

3. Access the frontend at `http://localhost:...`

### Deploy to Kubernetes

1. Apply Istio configuration and mesh setup.
2. Deploy microservices:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```
3. Validate mTLS, traffic routing, and observability via Istio’s dashboards or `kubectl`.

## Security Practices

* All inter-service communication is secured using mTLS.
* Traffic policies enforce security-aware routing (e.g., versioning, circuit breaking).
* Observability layers (metrics, logs, tracing) enable monitoring and detecting anomalies.
